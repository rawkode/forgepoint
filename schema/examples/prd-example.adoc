[abstract]
This PRD defines the requirements for a comprehensive authentication system that supports multiple login methods, enhances security, and provides a seamless user experience across all platform touchpoints.

== Problem Statement

Our current authentication system lacks modern security features and OAuth integration. Users struggle with password management, and we have no protection against brute force attacks. Support tickets related to login issues account for 30% of our volume.

== Goals

=== Primary Goals
* Reduce authentication-related support tickets by 50%
* Implement industry-standard security practices
* Support OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, Microsoft)
* Enable passwordless authentication options

=== Secondary Goals
* Improve login conversion rates by 15%
* Add SSO support for enterprise customers
* Implement audit logging for compliance

== Success Metrics

* Authentication-related support tickets < 15% of total volume
* Login success rate > 95%
* Password reset completion rate > 80%
* OAuth adoption rate > 40% of new registrations
* Zero security incidents related to authentication

== Requirements

=== Functional Requirements

==== FR-1: Multi-Factor Authentication
* Users can enable 2FA via TOTP apps
* SMS backup codes for recovery
* Recovery codes for account access

==== FR-2: OAuth Integration
* Support Google, GitHub, Microsoft OAuth
* Account linking for existing users
* OAuth-only accounts (no password required)

==== FR-3: Password Security
* Minimum 8 characters with complexity rules
* Bcrypt hashing with adaptive rounds
* Password history (prevent reuse of last 5)
* Forced password reset for compromised accounts

==== FR-4: Account Security
* Account lockout after 5 failed attempts
* Progressive delays between attempts
* Email notifications for suspicious activity
* Device tracking and management

=== Non-Functional Requirements

==== NFR-1: Performance
* Login response time < 200ms (95th percentile)
* OAuth callback handling < 500ms
* Support 1000 concurrent authentications

==== NFR-2: Reliability
* 99.9% uptime for authentication services
* Graceful degradation when OAuth providers are down
* Database failover with < 30s recovery time

==== NFR-3: Security
* OWASP compliance for authentication flows
* Rate limiting on all endpoints
* Audit logs for all authentication events
* PCI DSS compliance for payment flows

== User Stories

* xref:story:auth-login[] - Basic email/password authentication
* xref:story:oauth-registration[] - OAuth provider registration
* xref:story:two-factor-auth[] - 2FA setup and usage
* xref:story:password-reset[] - Self-service password reset
* xref:story:account-lockout[] - Security lockout handling

== Technical Requirements

=== Architecture
* Microservice architecture with dedicated auth service
* Redis for session storage and rate limiting
* PostgreSQL for user data and audit logs
* API Gateway for request routing and rate limiting

=== APIs
* RESTful APIs following OpenAPI 3.0 specification
* JWT tokens for session management
* Webhook support for account events

=== Security
* HTTPS everywhere with HSTS headers
* CSP headers on all authentication pages
* Input validation and sanitization
* SQL injection prevention

== Dependencies

=== Internal Dependencies
* User profile service updates
* Email service configuration
* Database migration scripts
* Frontend authentication components

=== External Dependencies
* OAuth provider applications setup
* SSL certificate renewal process
* Email deliverability improvements
* Security audit completion

== Timeline

=== Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4)
* Database schema design and migration
* Basic email/password authentication
* Password security implementation

=== Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8)
* OAuth integration (Google, GitHub)
* Account security features
* Rate limiting implementation

=== Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12)
* Two-factor authentication
* Audit logging and monitoring
* Performance optimization and testing

== Risks

== Open Questions

* Should we support SAML for enterprise customers in Phase 1?
* What's the timeline for deprecating the legacy authentication system?
* Do we need GDPR compliance features for EU users?
* Should biometric authentication be considered for mobile apps?
