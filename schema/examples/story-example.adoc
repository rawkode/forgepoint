[abstract]
As a user, I want to securely authenticate into the platform using email/password or OAuth providers so that I can access my personalized content and maintain account security.

== Acceptance Criteria

* [ ] User can register with email/password
* [ ] User can login with email/password
* [ ] User can login with Google OAuth
* [ ] User receives email verification after registration
* [ ] Password reset flow works correctly
* [ ] Account lockout after 5 failed attempts
* [ ] Session expires after 24 hours of inactivity

== Scenarios

[source,gherkin]
----
Feature: User Authentication

  Scenario: Successful email registration
    Given I am on the registration page
    When I enter valid email "user@example.com"
    And I enter password "SecurePass123!"
    And I click "Sign Up"
    Then I should receive a verification email
    And I should see "Please check your email to verify your account"

  Scenario: Login with verified account
    Given I have a verified account with email "user@example.com"
    And I am on the login page
    When I enter email "user@example.com"
    And I enter password "SecurePass123!"
    And I click "Log In"
    Then I should be redirected to the dashboard
    And I should see "Welcome back, User"

  Scenario: Failed login attempt
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter email "user@example.com"
    And I enter incorrect password "WrongPassword"
    And I click "Log In"
    Then I should see "Invalid email or password"
    And I should remain on the login page

== Technical Notes

NOTE: Use bcrypt for password hashing with minimum 10 rounds.

WARNING: Ensure OAuth tokens are stored securely and never logged.

IMPORTANT: Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints.

== Dependencies

* [ ] Database schema migration for users table
* [ ] Email service configuration (SendGrid/Mailgun)
* [ ] OAuth app credentials (Google, GitHub)
* [ ] Redis setup for session management
